title: The Practice of Spatial Index in Geographic Service
abstract: "
  I share my practice 《Application of spatial index in geographic service》. The contents are as follows:
<br>
  - How to understand n-dimensional space and n-dimensional space-time
<br>
  - Efficient multi-dimensional spatial point indexing algorithm — Geohash and Google S2
<br>
  - How to generate CellID in Google S2?
<br>
  - The algorithm of finding LCA recent public ancestor on the quadtree in Google S2 
<br>
  - The magical of Bruyne sequence
<br>
  - How to find the neighbors of Hilbert curve on the quadtree?
<br>
  - How does Google S2 solve the problem of optimal solution in spatial coverage?
