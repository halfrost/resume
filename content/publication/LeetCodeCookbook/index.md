abstract: '
This book is for the programming enthusiasts who want to improve algorithm capabilities through LeetCode. The algorithms in this book are all implemented in Go language. The code is placed in the github repo, and the topic can be searched by the question number. The code for the leetcode problems in this book has beats 100%. Without the beats 100% solution, it would not be included in this book. The author will continue to optimize those topics to 100% before putting them in.
<br>
Readers may ask, why pursue 100% beats. The author thinks that optimizing to 100% beats can be considered as a master for this question. There are several Hard questions, the author has used violence to solve AC, and then only beats 5%. This question is as if not done. And if such an answer is given in the interview, the interviewer will not be satisfied, "Is there a better solution?" If you can give a better solution through your own thinking, the interviewer will be more satisfied. Of course, if there are other more beautiful solutions that can beats 100%, please submit a PR and I will learn with you.
